<h1>Password manager tests</h1>

<li>STEP 1: Enable password manager if necessary,
<a href="https://{{ SERVER_NAME }}/{{ SERVER_PATH }}/.auth_form.html" target="_blank">click here</a>, type a random login and password such
as test/test, submit it, and be sure to tell the manager to save it.<p>

<li>STEP 2: Go again to
<a href="https://{{ SERVER_NAME }}/{{ SERVER_PATH }}/.auth_form.html" target="_blank">the same site</a> and make sure that password entry is
auto-completed by the manager (depending on the model, you might need to type the login to see the password auto-completed, etc).<p>

<li>STEP 3: Go
<a href="http://{{ SERVER_NAME }}/{{ SERVER_PATH }}/.auth_form.html" target="_blank">here</a>. If password auto-completion is offered,
scheme is not validated (if not, it is).<p>

<li>STEP 4: Go
<a href="https://{{ SERVER_NAME }}/{{ SERVER_PATH }}/.auth_form_copy.html" target="_blank">here</a>. If password auto-completion is offered,
URL is not strictly validated (if not, it probably is).<p>
